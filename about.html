                    <h2>About Vue</h2>
                    <p>Vue is an innovative augmented reality (AR) experience designed to immerse users in the world of color vision deficiency. Through advanced color filtering technology, Vue allows users to step into the shoes of individuals with different types of colorblindness, providing a powerful, first-hand understanding of their visual experience.</p>
                    <p>By simulating the various ways color is perceived by those with color vision deficiencies, Vue fosters empathy, awareness, and appreciation for the challenges faced by millions of people. This interactive tool not only educates users but also encourages a deeper commitment to creating more inclusive and accessible designs in all areas of life.</p>

                        <p>Tritanopia is a rare form of color blindness that affects the perception of blue and yellow colors. People with tritanopia have difficulty distinguishing between blue and green colors, and yellow can appear as light gray or violet. This condition affects less than 0.1% of the population and is caused by the absence or dysfunction of blue-sensitive photoreceptors in the retina.</p>

                        <p>Protanopia is a type of red-green color blindness where individuals have difficulty distinguishing between red and green colors. People with protanopia lack the long-wavelength sensitive cones in their retina, making reds appear darker and more like black. This condition affects approximately 1% of males and is much rarer in females due to its X-linked inheritance pattern.</p>

                        <p>Deuteranopia is the most common form of color blindness, affecting about 1 in 12 men and 1 in 200 women worldwide. It's characterized by the inability to distinguish between red and green colors due to the absence of medium-wavelength sensitive cones in the retina. Unlike protanopia, people with deuteranopia don't perceive reds as darker, but still confuse reds and greens.</p>

                        <p>Monochromacy, also known as total color blindness, is an extremely rare condition where individuals can only see in shades of gray. People with monochromacy have no functioning cone cells in their retina, relying solely on rod cells which only detect light intensity, not color. This condition affects approximately 1 in 30,000 people and often comes with other vision problems like light sensitivity and poor visual acuity.</p>

                    <p>Color vision deficiency affects approximately 300 million people worldwide. By understanding how people with different types of colorblindness perceive the world, designers and developers can create more inclusive and accessible products.
